The Transformer architecture is powerful because it separates understanding and generating while allowing flexible, dynamic connections between the two.
By stacking multiple Encoder and Decoder layers, the model becomes capable of learning complex relationships in language, powering modern AI models that we use today.

Mastering this foundation opens the door to building smarter AI systems, from translation to chatbots to text summarization.
